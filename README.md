 “ECLPOD: An Extremely Compressed Lightweight Model for Pear Object Detection”
Project ECLPOD
License: MIT

Overview
This project aims to implement an Accuracy Compensation Strategy (ECLPOD) to assist in pear sorting based on the YOLOv7 pipeline. The goal is to create an efficient and accurate sorting system for pears, addressing challenges such as mutual occlusion among pear groups and variations in shape and color.

Important Note: The code will be fully open-source after the paper is published. Stay tuned for updates!

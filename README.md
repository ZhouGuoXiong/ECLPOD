“ECLPOD: An Extremely Compressed Lightweight Model for Pear Object Detection”

## Overview
This project aims to implement an Accuracy Compensation Strategy (ECLPOD) to assist in pear sorting based on the YOLOv7 pipeline. The goal is to create an efficient and accurate sorting system for pears, addressing challenges such as mutual occlusion among pear groups and variations in shape and color.

**Dataset**: We have created a large-scale, home-made pear dataset containing 73,51 single pear images, 11,234 few pear images, 12,592 multiple pear images, and 3,421 special pear images (a total of 34,598 pear images and 154,688 precisely marked objects). This dataset has been built using an image acquisition system based on pear sorting equipment, which helps overcome the limitations in detecting the features of the pear body, stem, and calyx in traditional visual methods.

Important Note: The code will be fully open-source after the paper is published. Stay tuned for updates!

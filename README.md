 “ECLPOD: An Extremely Compressed Lightweight Model for Pear Object Detection”
# Project Name

License: MIT

## Overview

This project aims to implement an Accuracy Compensation Strategy (ECLPOD) to assist in pear sorting based on the YOLOv7 pipeline. The goal is to create an efficient and accurate sorting system for pears, addressing challenges such as mutual occlusion among pear groups and variations in shape and color.

**Important Note**: The code will be fully open-source after the paper is published. Stay tuned for updates!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- Numpy

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_project_name.git
    ```
2. Change the working directory
    ```
    cd your_project_name
    ```
3. Install the required packages
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset in the following format:
    ```
    - data
        - train
            - images
                - img_1.jpg
                - img_2.jpg
                ...
            - labels
                - img_1.txt
                - img_2.txt
                ...
        - valid
            - images
                - img_1.jpg
                - img_2.jpg
                ...
            - labels
                - img_1.txt
                - img_2.txt
                ...
    ```

2. Train the model
    ```
    python train.py --data_folder "data/"
    ```

3. Evaluate the model
    ```
    python evaluate.py --data_folder "data/valid" --model_path "path/to/saved_model.pth"
    ```

4. Detect pears in a single image
    ```
    python detect.py --image_path "path/to/image.jpg" --model_path "path/to/saved_model.pth"
    ```
